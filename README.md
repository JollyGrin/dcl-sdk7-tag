# SDK7 Tag experiment

Making a game of tag with DCL SDK7

## Summary

In the room there will be 3 color totems where a user can pickup a colored ball (held in hand).

When the user picks up a ball, they get a ball over their head. The ball over their head has a power of 1. 

When a user with a ball stands next to someone else, a ball grows above their head up to power of 1. 

## TODO
- [ ] create totems
- [ ] Attach ball to hand & head to player and others
- [ ] System: when touching totem pickup ball in hand.
- [ ] MessageBus: emit when player picks up ball so others see ball in their hand
